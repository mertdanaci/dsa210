INTRODUCTION

This project investigates how daily habits such as sleep duration, caffeine intake, and phone usage affect study efficiency. By collecting and analyzing 30 days of personal behavioral data, I aimed to uncover meaningful patterns in my study time. Using statistical tools and visualizations, I examined which factors most influence how long I can study effectively in a day.

WHAT DID I DO?

Over the course of one month (March 15 â€“ April 15), I logged daily data across the following parameters:

Study Duration (in minutes)
Phone Usage (screen time in minutes)
Sleep Duration (hours of sleep)
Caffeine Intake (number of Starbucks Grande Lattes consumed)
Each day, I entered my data manually into an Excel sheet. My goal was to analyze correlations between these variables and identify how each factor affects the amount of time I study per day.

After gathering the data, I used Python and libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Statsmodels to conduct:

KEY VISUAL FINDINGS & INTERPRETATIONS

1) Correlation Heatmap
Phone Usage vs. Study Duration: Strong negative correlation
â†’ As phone screen time increases, study time decreases
Sleep Duration vs. Study Duration: Moderate positive correlation
â†’ More sleep leads to longer studying
Caffeine Intake vs. Study Duration: Positive correlation
â†’ A cup of coffee appears to support study stamina
2) Phone Usage vs. Study Duration

ðŸ¡’ A clear downward trend: Students who spent more time on their phone studied significantly less.

3) Sleep Duration vs. Study Duration

ðŸ¡’ Higher sleep durations often resulted in increased study time, with best performance after 7â€“8 hours of sleep.

4) Caffeine Intake vs. Study Duration

ðŸ¡’ Moderate caffeine consumption (1â€“2 cups/day) aligned with longer study sessions, though excess intake had no additional benefit.

CONCLUSION

The data confirms that digital distractions like phone usage significantly hinder effective study time. On the other hand, getting enough sleep and consuming caffeine in moderation appear to support productivity.

Recommendations:
Limit phone usage during study hours using app blockers or scheduled breaks.
Aim for 7â€“8 hours of sleep daily to maintain cognitive performance.
Use caffeine strategicallyâ€”a cup of coffee can boost energy, but overuse shows diminishing returns.
LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK

Only one subject (myself) was analyzed; generalizability is limited.
The study duration is short (1 month).
Focus level and study quality were not measuredâ€”future studies should incorporate these.
Future Directions:
Repeat the study with a larger sample of students.
Track more psychological variables like motivation, stress, or environmental noise.
Automate data collection using apps or wearables for greater accuracy.
FINAL WORDS

This project offered valuable insight into how everyday habits influence productivity. It empowered me to make informed lifestyle choices and set a strong foundation for future academic performance improvements.
