## Study Efficiency Analysis - DSA210 Project

# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors affecting study time and efficiency. Study duration will be examined alongside variables such as sleep schedule, caffeine intake, and phone usage to determine the most effective study conditions. The goal is to identify the best strategies for time management and academic performance improvement using data analysis.

# Objectives

Identify Factors Affecting Study Efficiency:
Analyze the relationship between sleep, caffeine intake, and phone usage with study efficiency.

Determine Key Variables:
Identify which factors have the strongest impact and adjust study habits accordingly.

Data-Driven Optimization:
Improve study routines and time management based on data insights.

Apply Data Science Techniques:
Use Python and statistical methods to analyze study efficiency.

# Research Questions

How does phone usage impact study efficiency? Does screen time during study sessions reduce study time?
Does sleep duration affect study performance?
Does caffeine intake support longer study durations?

# Hypothesis 

H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis): These factors (sleep, phone usage, caffeine intake) do not significantly affect study efficiency.

H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis): Certain factors significantly impact study efficiency:

- Longer sleep duration is associated with longer study sessions.
- Increased phone usage reduces study duration.
- Higher caffeine intake supports longer study durations.

# Dataset

Data to be Collected:

Factor                        | Measurement Method
-----------------------------|-------------------------
Date & Time                  | Logged daily
Study Duration               | Recorded in minutes
Phone Usage                  | iOS Screen Time / Digital Wellbeing (in minutes)
Sleep Duration               | Samsung Health / Sleep Cycle
Caffeine Intake              | Logged in number of coffee cups (e.g., Starbucks Grande Latte)

The data will be recorded daily using Google Sheets, Notion, or Excel.

# Findings & Insights

How Does Phone Usage Impact Studying?:
Does increased phone screen time correlate with lower study efficiency?

Does Sleep Affect Studying?:
Do students with more sleep study for longer and more effectively?

Does Caffeine Help?:
Does moderate caffeine intake enhance study session length?

# Limitations & Future Work

Limitations:

- Data is collected for a limited time, making long-term analysis difficult.

Future Improvements:

- Collecting data over a longer period (3‚Äì6 months) for better insights.
- Expanding the study to include more participants for broader results.
- Using automated tracking tools to measure focus and efficiency more accurately.

# Conclusion

This project aims to determine the best study methods to maximize efficiency. Study duration is likely influenced by sleep, phone usage, and caffeine intake. The results can help improve time management, minimize distractions, and create the most effective study environment. üöÄ
