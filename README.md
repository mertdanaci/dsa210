## Study Efficiency Analysis - DSA210 Project
# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors affecting study time and efficiency. Study duration will be examined alongside variables such as sleep schedule, nutrition, study environment, and phone usage to determine the most effective study conditions. The goal is to identify the best strategies for time management and academic performance improvement using data analysis.


 # Objectives

Identify Factors Affecting Study Efficiency:
Analyze the relationship between sleep, nutrition, study environment, and phone usage with study focus and efficiency.

Determine Key Variables:
Identify which factors have the strongest impact and adjust study habits accordingly.

Data-Driven Optimization:
Improve study routines and time management based on data insights.

Apply Data Science Techniques:
Use Python and statistical methods to analyze study efficiency.


# Research Questions

What is the most efficient time of the day to study? Morning vs. evening?
How does phone usage impact study efficiency? Does screen time during study sessions reduce focus?
Do sleep duration and nutrition habits affect study performance?
How does the study environment (silence, background noise, or music) impact concentration?

# Hypothesis 

H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis): These factors (sleep, phone usage, nutrition, study environment) do not significantly affect study efficiency.
H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis): Certain factors significantly impact study efficiency:

Longer sleep duration is associated with better focus and longer study sessions.
Increased phone usage reduces study duration and efficiency.
A noisy study environment decreases focus and shortens study time.
Balanced nutrition (protein & carbohydrates) enhances study performance.

# Dataset

Data to be Collected:

Factor	                                          Measurement Method

Date & Time	                                     Logged daily
Study Duration                                  	Recorded in hours
Focus Level	                                     Self-assessed on a scale of 1-10
Phone Usage	                                     iOS Screen Time / Digital Wellbeing (in minutes)
Sleep Duration                                  	Samsung Health / Sleep Cycle
Nutrition (Protein & Carbs)	                     Logged daily via MyFitnessPal or Notion
Study Environment                               	Categorized as Silence / Noise / Music
Break Time & Frequency	                          Total break duration (in minutes)
Study Period	                                    Categorized into Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night


The data will be recorded daily using Google Sheets, Notion, or Excel.



# Finding & Insights

What Is the Best Study Time?:
Comparison between morning and evening study sessions.

How Does Phone Usage Impact Studying?:
Does increased phone screen time correlate with lower study efficiency?

Do Sleep & Nutrition Affect Studying?:
Do students with more sleep study for longer and more effectively?
Does protein intake influence study duration?

Study Environment & Productivity:
Do students focus better in silence, with music, or in a noisy environment?


# Limitations & Future Work

Limitations:

The study efficiency score is subjective (self-reported focus scores).
Data is collected for a limited time, making long-term analysis difficult.

Future Improvements:

Collecting data over a longer period (3-6 months) for better insights.
Expanding the study to include more participants for broader results.
Using automated tracking tools to measure focus and efficiency more accurately.


# Conclusion

This project aims to determine the best study methods to maximize efficiency. Study duration and effectiveness are likely influenced by sleep, phone usage, nutrition, and the study environment. The results can help improve time management, minimize distractions, and create the most effective study environment. üöÄ
